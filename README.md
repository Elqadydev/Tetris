# Tetris Coded in Python by Elqady

A Tetris game coded in Python.

The code worked with the following Python 3 and Pygame versions:

- Python 3.9.0, pygame 2.0.1
- Python 3.7.4, pygame 1.9.6
- Python 3.6.5, pygame 1.9.3

## Installation Guide (Windows 10)

Install the latest exe version and run it.

## Windows Defender SmartScreen Warning

If you see a SmartScreen warning, it's because the game is new and the source code is public. It's a false positive, and you can bypass it safely by clicking "More Info" and selecting "Run Anyway."
